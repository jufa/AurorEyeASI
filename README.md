## 3D Printable Shell
This repository includes an .3mf file for 3D printing. Preferred material is PETG.

## Development projects for students, researchers
### Hardware
* Low temperature tolerant LiFePO4 battery pack characterization
* Updates to KiCAD design files for Pi “HAT” circuit board
* Manufacturability considerations (maybe 3D printed internal frame for sensor alignment and support)
* Heat flow/moisture characterization and management (dew point, built-in heaters, condensation prevention for longer periods of deployment)
* 3D printed shell with in-built insulative properties, stackable, modular (in progress now)

### Optics and Sensor Characterization
* Optical characterization (lens, camera, distortion and light falloff parameters)
* Image file transforms (Camera internal color and post processing characterization)
* possible calibration with distortion from a weather cover dome

### Comms and UI
* Test with satellite or cellular Wifi
* Modify cloud upload for appropriate cloud environment (right now it is google cloud)
* UI development (currently a web app which provides flexibility as well as onboard buttons and display)
* Improvements or characterization of camera communication using established open source library (gPhoto2)

### Software/Firmware
* Onboard firmware updates, (branches off of main github repository with new features)
* Post processing tools updates (OpenCV, Python, Davinci Resolve Fusion workflows)
* Archiving, storing, and sharing system website (currently youtube and local backup servers of still image sequences)

### Skill areas for students
* Batteries and power electronics
* Temperature management hardware and sensing
* Magnetometers, Accelerometers for alignment
* Python programming
* Cloud API interface
* GitHub software collaboration
* Image processing and characterization using OpenCV or other open tools
* Image recognition/Machine Learning/AI
* 3D CAD/CAM
* Web Application development
* Video editing for outreach
* Field work campaigning and collaboration between multiple instruments
* Fabrication with Aluminum and Plastic
* Electronics assembly, packaging for harsh environments
